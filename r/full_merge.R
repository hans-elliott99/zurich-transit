##                 ZURICH TRANSPORT - FULL MERGED DATA                         ##
##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------##
# Author: Hans Elliott
# About: This script compiles passenger data from the Zurich Transport Authority 
#        (Fahrzeugs der Verkehrsbetriebe ZÃ¼rich, or VBZ). 
#        *Some of this script is adapted from scripts provided by the official
#        VBZ github (https://github.com/VerkehrsbetriebeZuerich). 
#        The link to the specific script is below:
#        https://github.com/VerkehrsbetriebeZuerich/ogd_examples_R/blob/main/05_Skripte/example_passengerdata.R
# Data: The data files used in the script are created by the partner scripts described below.
# Project: This script merges the ZBA passenger and punctuality data, creating a 
#          full dataset for a machine learning project.
#          The partner scripts are titled: 'punctuality.R' & 'passenger.R', which will process
#          and output the data needed for this merge file
# Full Machine Learning Project: https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit

# Notes for Hans:
# No night transit in this week sample, so any vars related to night transit are dropped in select df
# line 2 is most common, it is type T (with some NAs, but most likely due to the transit_type
# coming from the passenger data and not matching to every ride, so could be imputed)
# believe corresponds to the S2
